## Flask

Flask is a python micro-service framework that can help you make REST APIs and basic websites. It requires 
a prerequisite of HTML, and a knowledge of the Jinja2 templating engine, whose documentation can also be found on
the Flask Project's official website.

Created is a basic website, using Bootstrap for front end and Flask for backend -> this is not compulsory, but makes the website
look just a little bit better.

Knowledge of HTML forms goes a long way, since they are a crucial part to pretty much EVERY website.

Note that the code is written not following the "standard" way of dealing with forms, which is through the flask extension
package Flask-WTF, and doing this would require the programmer to write out form validation code himself.

Flask is helpful for small websites and REST APIs, but can be a little bloated for large projects.
